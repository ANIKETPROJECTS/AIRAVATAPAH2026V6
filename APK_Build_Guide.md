# कृषी सुविधा — Android APK Build Guide

**App Name:** कृषी सुविधा (Krushi Suvidha)  
**Package:** com.agrimh.krishisuvidha  
**API:** https://krushisuvidhaai.airavatatechnologies.com/api  

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed on your Windows machine:

| Tool | Download Link |
|------|--------------|
| Node.js (v18 or higher) | https://nodejs.org |

> **Note:** On Windows, use **Command Prompt** (cmd). `ls` does not work — use `dir`. `clear` does not work — use `cls`.

---

## Step 1 — Install EAS CLI

Open **Command Prompt** and run:

```cmd
npm install -g eas-cli
```

Verify it installed correctly:

```cmd
eas --version
```

You should see something like `eas-cli/18.x.x win32-x64 node-v22.x.x`.

---

## Step 2 — Create a Free Expo Account

1. Go to **https://expo.dev**
2. Click **Sign Up**
3. Fill in your name, email, and password
4. Verify your email address
5. Note down your **username** — you will need it in the next step

---

## Step 3 — Download the kisan-mitra Folder (Fresh Copy)

> ⚠️ **Always delete your old folder and download a fresh copy before each build attempt.** Every time a fix is applied in Replit, you must re-download — the old folder on your computer will NOT have the fix.

1. Open your Replit project
2. Right-click the `artifacts/kisan-mitra` folder in the file tree
3. Click **Download**
4. **Delete** your old `C:\kisan-mitra` folder first, then extract the new zip to:

```
C:\kisan-mitra\
```

After extracting, confirm these files exist inside the folder:

```
C:\kisan-mitra\
  assets\
    icon.png          ← app icon (required)
    splash.png        ← splash screen (required)
    favicon.png       ← web favicon (required)
    adaptive-icon.png ← Android adaptive icon (required)
  src\
  app.json
  eas.json
  package.json
  App.tsx
  .npmrc
```

> If the `assets\` folder is missing, the build **will fail**. Make sure you downloaded the latest version from Replit.

---

## Step 3b — (Alternative) Fix Without Re-downloading

If you do not want to re-download the whole folder, run this one command inside your existing `C:\kisan-mitra\kisan-mitra` folder to apply the latest fix:

```cmd
npm install react-native-safe-area-context@5.0.0 --legacy-peer-deps
```

Then continue with Step 8 (skip to the build command). Do **not** run `npm install` again after this — just run the build.

---

## Step 4 — Open Command Prompt in the kisan-mitra Folder

```cmd
cd C:\kisan-mitra
```

Verify you are in the right place:

```cmd
dir
```

You should see `package.json`, `app.json`, `eas.json`, `assets`, `src`.

---

## Step 5 — Install Dependencies

```cmd
npm install
```

Wait for it to finish. You will see `added 700+ packages`.

---

## Step 6 — Login to EAS

```cmd
eas login
```

Enter your **Expo username** and **password** when prompted.

> ⚠️ When it asks "Email or username", type your **username** (not your email address). If you enter your email, it will show an error about password length — just run `eas login` again and use your username.

Confirm login:

```cmd
eas whoami
```

It should display your Expo username.

---

## Step 7 — Link the Project to Your Expo Account

```cmd
eas init
```

- It will ask: **"Would you like to create a new EAS project?"** → Press `Y` and Enter
- It creates a project on your Expo dashboard and updates `app.json` with a project ID

> If you already ran `eas init` before (previous failed build), it will just re-link — that is fine.

---

## Step 8 — Build the Production APK

```cmd
eas build --platform android --profile production --no-build-cache
```

> ⚠️ Always use `--no-build-cache` to force a completely fresh build. Without it, EAS may reuse old cached packages from a previous failed build.

### What happens:
1. EAS uploads your code to Expo's cloud servers
2. Build runs entirely in the cloud — your machine does nothing
3. You will see a progress URL like:  
   `https://expo.dev/accounts/YOUR_USERNAME/projects/kisan-mitra/builds/xxxx`
4. **Build time: approximately 10–15 minutes**

### Expected build phases (all should show ✅):
- Spin up build environment
- Prepare project
- Read eas.json
- Read package.json
- Install dependencies
- Read app config
- Run expo doctor
- Prebuild
- **Run gradlew** ← this was failing before, now fixed
- Upload build artifacts

---

## Step 9 — Download the APK

Once the build shows **Finished**:

1. Open the build URL from your terminal  
   *(or go to https://expo.dev → your account → Projects → kisan-mitra → Builds)*
2. Click **Download** next to the completed build
3. You get a file like `kisan-mitra-production.apk`

---

## Step 10 — Install the APK on an Android Phone

### Method A — Direct USB Transfer
1. Connect phone to PC via USB
2. Allow **File Transfer** mode on the phone
3. Copy the `.apk` to the phone's Downloads folder
4. On the phone: open **Files** app → Downloads → tap the APK
5. If blocked: **Settings → Apps → Special App Access → Install Unknown Apps** → enable for Files app
6. Tap **Install**

### Method B — Google Drive / WhatsApp
1. Upload the `.apk` to Google Drive or send to yourself on WhatsApp
2. Open on the Android phone and install

---

## What the App Does After Installation

Once installed, the कृषी सुविधा app:

- Connects to your live VPS at `https://krushisuvidhaai.airavatatechnologies.com/api`
- Farmers log in with mobile number + OTP
- Upload documents (Aadhaar, Bank Passbook, Form 7, Form 12, Form 8A)
- View government schemes, subsidies, and insurance
- Raise and track grievances
- Receive notifications from the admin panel

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Gradle build failed / Run gradlew error** | Re-download a fresh copy of kisan-mitra from Replit — both the New Architecture fix and the safe-area-context v5 upgrade are now included |
| **`compileReleaseKotlin FAILED` / SafeAreaProviderManager error** | Re-download kisan-mitra from Replit — `react-native-safe-area-context` has been upgraded to v5 which fixes this |
| **Prebuild failed** | Re-download kisan-mitra from Replit (fresh copy) — make sure the assets folder is present |
| `npm install` gives `ERESOLVE` | The `.npmrc` file handles this automatically. If still failing, run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` |
| `eas: command not found` | Run `npm install -g eas-cli`, then close and reopen Command Prompt |
| Login error "password must contain 1 char" | Use your Expo **username** not your email address when logging in |
| `Not logged in` | Run `eas login` again |
| APK installs but cannot connect | Verify nginx on your VPS is proxying `/api/` → `localhost:3014` and the API server is running |
| `Install blocked` on phone | Settings → Apps → Special App Access → Install Unknown Apps → enable for Files |
| `ls` not working | Use `dir` on Windows instead |

---

## Rebuilding After Code Changes

1. Download a fresh copy of `artifacts/kisan-mitra` from Replit
2. Open Command Prompt in that folder
3. Run:

```cmd
npm install
eas build --platform android --profile production --no-build-cache
```

You do **not** need to run `eas init` again — it only needs to be done once.

## May 2026 Update — All Bug Fixes

### Fix 1 — Document Upload "Network request failed" (Android)

**Root cause:** `typeof window !== 'undefined'` is always `true` in React Native (window is polyfilled), so the app was incorrectly treating Android as a web browser and trying to `fetch()` a local `file://` URI instead of attaching it as a blob to FormData.

**Fix:** Changed the platform check to `Platform.OS === 'web'` in `api.ts → uploadDocument`. On Android, the file URI is now appended directly as a `{ uri, name, type }` native blob — the correct React Native approach.

---

### Fix 2 — Profile Screen Shows Only "Personal Details" (APK + Web)

**Root cause (layer 1):** The production VPS API may return OCR data inside `extractionData` (nested sections/fields format) without merging it into the flat `ocr` field the profile screen reads.

**Root cause (layer 2):** Even when neither `ocr` nor `extractionData` is available, the farmer document always has top-level fields populated (`name`, `aadhaar`, `dob`, `gender`, `fatherName`, `address`, `bankName`, `ifsc`, `bankAccount`, `village`, `district`, etc.) — extracted during document upload.

**Fix:** Replaced `deriveOcrFromExtractionData` with a new `enrichFarmerOcr()` function that applies **two layers of enrichment**:
1. **Layer 1** — Derives `ocr` sections from `extractionData.{docId}.sections[].fields[]` (handles the case where VPS returns raw extraction data)
2. **Layer 2 fallback** — Builds `ocr.aadhar`, `ocr.passbook`, `ocr.form7`, `ocr.form12`, `ocr.form8a` from top-level farmer fields, so all sections are shown regardless of VPS API version

This is called in **three** places in `AuthContext.tsx`:
- On app boot (restoring session from storage)
- On OTP login (verifyOtp result)
- On every `refreshFarmer` poll

---

### Fix 3 — Port 8008 Web Preview Shows Stale "Pending" After VPS Verification

**Root cause:** The port 8008 web preview was calling the **local Replit API** (port 8000) which has a **separate database** from the VPS. When admin verifies a farmer via the VPS admin panel, the VPS MongoDB gets updated — but the local Replit MongoDB still had the old Pending record. The web app was reading from a different database than the APK.

**Fix:** Updated `getApiBase()` in `api.ts` so that **all non-localhost environments** (including the Replit `*.replit.dev` preview domain) use the **production VPS API**:
- `localhost:8008` → `http://localhost:8000/api` (local dev only)
- `*.replit.dev:8008` → `https://krushisuvidhaai.airavatatechnologies.com/api` ✅
- Android APK → `https://krushisuvidhaai.airavatatechnologies.com/api` ✅

Both the port 8008 web preview and the APK now always talk to the **same production database**.

---

### Fix 4 — On-Screen Debug Log Panel

A collapsible `🔧 Debug Log` panel appears on the Document Upload screen after the first upload attempt, showing Platform, API URL, file details, and any errors.

---

## API Routing Summary

| Environment | API Used |
|---|---|
| Android APK | `https://krushisuvidhaai.airavatatechnologies.com/api` |
| Port 8008 on Replit | `https://krushisuvidhaai.airavatatechnologies.com/api` |
| `localhost:8008` (local dev) | `http://localhost:8000/api` |

---

## Updating Your VPS API Server

The updated API server build is at `artifacts/api-server/dist/`. Copy it to your VPS and restart:

```bash
# On your VPS (via Hostinger terminal)
cd /path/to/your/api
# Upload artifacts/api-server/dist/ from Replit to this folder
# Then restart:
PORT=8000 MONGODB_URI=... DATALAB_API_KEY=... NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.mjs
```

The updated API server includes server-side `deriveOcrFromExtractionData` so the VPS will return fully populated `ocr` fields directly, making responses faster and more reliable.

---

## Important Notes

- Both the APK and port 8008 web preview now call `https://krushisuvidhaai.airavatatechnologies.com/api`
- You do **not** need Android Studio, Java, or Android SDK — Expo builds in the cloud
- Each build uses ~10–15 minutes of your free Expo build quota
- To test against local API, run on `localhost:8008` (e.g. `expo start --web --port 8008` locally)
